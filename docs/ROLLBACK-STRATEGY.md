## 🔄 Rollback Overview

### When to Rollback

Execute a rollback immediately if:

- [ ] **Critical Bug**: Application crashes or is unusable
- [ ] **Security Vulnerability**: Security breach detected
- [ ] **Data Loss**: User data is being corrupted or lost
- [ ] **Performance Degradation**: >50% increase in load times
- [ ] **API Failures**: >10% error rate on critical endpoints
- [ ] **Feature Breakage**: Core features not working
- [ ] **User Impact**: Affecting >5% of users

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Severity     | Impact       | Action                 | Timeline     |
| ------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------ |
| **Critical** | All users    | Immediate rollback     | < 5 minutes  |
| **High**     | >50% users   | Fast rollback          | < 15 minutes |
| **Medium**   | 10-50% users | Evaluated rollback     | < 1 hour     |
| **Low**      | <10% users   | Hotfix or next release | < 24 hours   |

---

## 🛡️ Pre-Deployment Safeguards

### 1. Version Tagging

```bash
# Before deployment, tag the current stable version
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Stable production version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0

# Document the deployment
echo "Deployed v1.0.0 on $(date)" >> deployment-log.txt
```

### 2. Backup Current Version

```bash
# Vercel - Automatic backups via deployment history
# Access via: https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments

# AWS S3 - Create backup
aws s3 sync s3://production-bucket s3://backup-bucket/$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)/

# Netlify - Snapshots automatically created
# Access via: https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site/deploys
```

### 3. Feature Flags

```javascript
// src/utils/featureFlags.js
export const featureFlags = {
  newFeature: process.env.VITE_FEATURE_NEW === "true",
  experimentalUI: process.env.VITE_EXPERIMENTAL_UI === "true",

  // Rollback safety: disable features remotely
  isEnabled: (feature) => {
    return featureFlags[feature] ?? false;
  },
};

// Usage in components
if (featureFlags.isEnabled("newFeature")) {
  // Render new feature
} else {
  // Render stable version
}
```

### 4. Canary Deployment

```javascript
// Deploy to small percentage of users first
// Gradually increase traffic if no issues

// Vercel canary deployment
{
  "git": {
    "deploymentEnabled": {
      "main": true,
      "canary": true
    }
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Vercel Rollback

#### Method 1: Instant Rollback (Fastest)

```bash
# Via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/your-project/deployments
2. Find the last stable deployment
3. Click "..." menu → "Promote to Production"
4. Confirm rollback

# Rollback time: ~30 seconds
```

#### Method 2: CLI Rollback

```bash
# List recent deployments
vercel ls

# Rollback to specific deployment
vercel promote <deployment-url> --prod

# Or rollback to previous deployment
vercel rollback
```

#### Method 3: Git Rollback

```bash
# Revert to previous commit
git revert HEAD --no-edit
git push origin main

# Or reset to specific version
git reset --hard <commit-hash>
git push origin main --force

# Vercel auto-deploys from main
# Deployment time: ~2 minutes
```

### Netlify Rollback

```bash
# Via Netlify Dashboard
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site/deploys
2. Find the last stable deployment
3. Click "Publish deploy"
4. Confirm

# Via CLI
netlify deploy --prod --dir=<previous-build-dir>

# Or restore from backup
netlify deploy --prod --alias=<previous-alias>
```

### AWS CloudFront Rollback

```bash
# 1. Restore S3 bucket from backup
aws s3 sync s3://backup-bucket/BACKUP_DATE/ s3://production-bucket/ --delete

# 2. Invalidate CloudFront cache
aws cloudfront create-invalidation \
  --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID \
  --paths "/*"

# 3. Verify rollback
curl -I https://yourdomain.com/
```

### Docker Rollback

```bash
# Rollback to previous image
docker pull your-registry/jobpsych:previous-tag
docker stop jobpsych-frontend
docker rm jobpsych-frontend
docker run -d --name jobpsych-frontend \
  -p 80:80 \
  your-registry/jobpsych:previous-tag

# Kubernetes rollback
kubectl rollout undo deployment/jobpsych-frontend
kubectl rollout status deployment/jobpsych-frontend
```

### DNS Rollback

```bash
# If using blue-green deployment
# Switch DNS back to old environment

# Update DNS A record
# TTL should be low (300s) for fast propagation

# Verify DNS change
dig yourdomain.com
nslookup yourdomain.com
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always tag stable versions** before deploying
2. **Maintain backup copies** of previous builds
3. **Test rollback procedures** monthly
4. **Document all deployments** with versions and dates
5. **Use feature flags** for new features
6. **Monitor closely** after any deployment
7. **Have clear escalation paths** for incidents
8. **Communicate proactively** with users
