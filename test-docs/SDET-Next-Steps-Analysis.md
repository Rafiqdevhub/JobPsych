---

## Critical Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **PHASE 1: Fix Critical Test Issues (Week 1)**

#### 1.1 Fix React act() Warnings

**Impact:** High - Prevents test reliability and CI stability
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Files:** `src/components/__tests__/Chatbot.test.jsx`

**Issue:** 27 tests showing "not wrapped in act()" warnings
**Solution:**

```javascript
// Current (problematic)
fireEvent.click(button);

// Fixed (proper)
act(() => {
  fireEvent.click(button);
});
```

**Implementation:**

- Update all 27 Chatbot test cases
- Add `import { act } from '@testing-library/react'`
- Run tests to verify warnings eliminated

#### 1.2 Implement Page-Level Unit Tests

**Impact:** High - Pages represent 60% of application functionality
**Effort:** 2-3 days
**Coverage Target:** 80% page coverage

**Missing Tests:**

- `src/pages/__tests__/LandingPage.test.jsx`
- `src/pages/__tests__/ATSAnalyzer.test.jsx`
- `src/pages/__tests__/RoleSuggestion.test.jsx`
- `src/pages/__tests__/InterviewPrepAI.test.jsx`
- `src/pages/__tests__/HireDisk.test.jsx`
- `src/pages/__tests__/NotFound.test.jsx`

**Test Strategy:**

```javascript
// LandingPage.test.jsx structure
describe("LandingPage", () => {
  test("renders hero section", () => {
    render(<LandingPage />);
    expect(screen.getByRole("banner")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test("displays all feature sections", () => {
    render(<LandingPage />);
    expect(screen.getByText("AI-Powered Analysis")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  test("includes chatbot component", () => {
    render(<LandingPage />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId("chatbot-button")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### **PHASE 2: Improve Test Coverage (Week 2)**

#### 2.1 Component Coverage Completion

**Target Components:**

- `HeroSection.jsx` (283 lines, 0% coverage)
- `Footer.jsx` (271 lines, 0% coverage)
- `Toast.jsx` (587 lines, 31.55% coverage)
- `TypewriterText.jsx` (26 lines, 0% coverage)

**Coverage Goals:**

- HeroSection: 90% (accessibility, animations, CTA buttons)
- Footer: 85% (links, social media, navigation)
- Toast: 80% (notifications, error states, interactions)
- TypewriterText: 95% (animation logic, text rendering)

#### 2.2 Integration Test Expansion

**Current:** 42 integration tests
**Target:** 75+ integration tests

**Missing Integration Tests:**

- **File Upload Workflows:** Resume upload → ATS analysis → results display
- **Multi-step Forms:** Interview prep form completion
- **Error Recovery:** Network failures → retry mechanisms
- **State Persistence:** Page refresh data retention
- **Cross-Component Communication:** Chatbot ↔ page interactions

### **PHASE 3: Test Quality & Reliability (Week 3)**

#### 3.1 Visual Regression Testing

**Tools:** Playwright + @playwright/test + playwright-visual-comparison
**Implementation:**

```javascript
// playwright.config.js addition
use: {
  screenshot: 'only-on-failure',
  video: 'retain-on-failure',
  trace: 'on-first-retry',
},

// Visual test example
test('landing page visual regression', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/');
  await expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('landing-page.png');
});
```

**Coverage Areas:**

- Landing page layouts
- Feature sections
- Chatbot interface
- Form components
- Error states

#### 3.2 Performance Testing Integration

**Tools:** Playwright + Lighthouse CI
**Metrics to Track:**

- First Contentful Paint (FCP) < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) < 0.1
- First Input Delay (FID) < 100ms

#### 3.3 Accessibility Testing Enhancement

**Current:** Basic ARIA label tests
**Target:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

**Tools:** axe-playwright, @playwright/test

```javascript
// Accessibility test example
test("landing page accessibility", async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto("/");
  const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page }).analyze();
  expect(results.violations).toEqual([]);
});
```

### **PHASE 4: CI/CD & Monitoring (Week 4)**

#### 4.1 GitHub Actions Pipeline

**Required Workflows:**

- **PR Checks:** Unit + Integration tests
- **E2E Pipeline:** Full browser matrix testing
- **Coverage Reports:** PR comments with coverage diffs
