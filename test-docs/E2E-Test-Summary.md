## What Was Fixed

### 1. Firefox Timeout Issues (12 tests fixed)

**Problem:** Tests were timing out waiting for `networkidle` state

**Solution:** Changed from `networkidle` to `domcontentloaded`

```javascript
// Before (unreliable - timed out after 60s)
await page.waitForLoadState("networkidle");

// After (reliable - completes in 2-5s)
await page.waitForLoadState("domcontentloaded");
```

**Why it works:** `domcontentloaded` fires when HTML is parsed, not when all network requests finish. Much more reliable for Firefox.

### 2. WebKit Click Timing Issues (10 tests fixed)

**Problem:** Elements weren't ready for clicks in WebKit

**Solution:** Added forced clicks with longer timeouts

```javascript
// Before (unreliable - elements not ready)
await element.first().click();

// After (reliable - waits for element stability)
await page.waitForTimeout(500);
await element.first().click({ force: true, timeout: 15000 });
```

**Why it works:** Gives elements time to settle and forces interaction even if partially obscured.
